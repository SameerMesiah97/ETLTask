# ETLTask
In this task, I was given a csv file which contained a lot of invalid data such as rows with missing 
information and invalid dates. I had to write a python script to clean all the data in the file and copy it
to another file. The script also altered the structure of the csv file by removing the 'Zscore', 'gender' 
and 'syllabus' columns.
